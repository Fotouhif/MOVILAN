Data generation-> datagen.py

Training -> unet_ling.py

Inference -> cross_modal_grounding.py (a very simple sample demonstration- can point to an image and set your own language inside the code)



Before training always use the datagen.py to generate your own data. The data will be generated in data/rgb/, data/seg/ and data/descriptions.json
some examples are included in data/rgb/ and data/seg/
